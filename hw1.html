    <img src="Images/LBI.jpg" align="left" height="400">
    <p> LBI is my favorite place because it's close to home and a summer escape. </p>
    <p> Driving over that bridge onto the island and knowing you're going to
      enjoy the beach is such a relaxing feeling. </p>

    <p> Something nobody would expect about me: I was in a MrBeast video where,
        the prize was $10k, but sadly ended up losing.
