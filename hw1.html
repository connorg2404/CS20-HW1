    LBI is my favorite place because it's <br /> close to home and a summer escape. <br />
    Driving over that bridge onto the island <br /> and knowing you're going to
    enjoy the <br /> beach is such a relaxing feeling. <br />

    <p> Something nobody would expect about me: I was in a MrBeast video where
      the prize was $10k, but I sadly ended up losing.
